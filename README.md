# FCPS Tech exploits
A list of functioning offline downloads for all of the stuff on my website after it got blocked, as well as instructions for bypassing consorship and jailbreaking school computers in FCPS.

> [!WARNING]
> Sh1mmer works on FCPS chromebooks. View the writeup [here](https://github.com/CaenJones/crazy-repo/blob/main/shimmer.md)

> Shimboot also works.

# Chromebooks
Most people at FCPS have been switched to chromebooks, which are much harder to jailbreak than to old Windows laptops. 

G10 chromebooks (drawper) have cr50 chips, which the G11 ones (yavijo) have ti50, making it harder (if not impossible) to unenroll.  

To prevent admin from finding out about your unenrollment, use **fakemurk** or **murkmod** (recommended) to fake enrollment. See the corresponding section below for more details.

## Downgrading kernel versions (kernver version switcher)

To prevent most exploits being patched, you can downgrade both chrome version and kernver to something manageable.

Use KVS, with a full writeup and instructions available here: https://github.com/kxtzownsu/KVS

Get images from chrome100.dev

G11 Chromebook: `nissa`

G10 Chromebook: `dedede`

Full instructions are available here: https://chrome100.dev/guide

## Sh1mmer
As of September 16th (2024 I think), sh1mmer with the tsunami bypass has been confirmed working with ChromeOS r128. This exploit allows for unenrollment and the ability to switch into developer mode, plus other things.

FCPS Chromebooks come in two models - HP Fortis G10 and G11. You can check this on the underside of the chromebook, which will usually be under the FCPS barcode (this varies from school to school).

G11 Chromebook: `nissa`

G10 Chromebook: `dedede`

Full writeup is available here: https://github.com/catfoolyou/Block-Bypass/blob/main/shimmer.md

## Shimboot
Shimboot is an exploit based on sh1mmer that boots a linux distribution off a USB or a spoofed unenrolled chromeOS. It works because the rootfs of the shim (a recovery image) is not verified, meaning that it can be replaced with whatever else.

FCPS High School chromebooks (`drawper`) have NOT been tested with shimboot yet.

Full writeup is available here: https://github.com/catfoolyou/Block-Bypass/blob/main/shimboot.md

## Fakemurk/murkmod
To prevent admin from checking unenrollment via GAC (admin console) and finding unenrolled chromebooks, use FakeMurk or Murkmod.

Note that [Fakemurk](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/fakemurk) is UNMAINTAINED, so murkmod is recommended.

Murkmod REQUIRES devmode (set GBB flags to `0x8000`, `0x8090`, or `0x8091`), though you probaby should have that enabled if you unenrolled.

Installation instructions are available here: https://github.com/rainestorme/murkmod/blob/main/docs/installation.md

## Webview exploit
A random hole in chrome login that allows for unrestriced browsing (one tab only)

1) Add an account to chrome or go to chrome://chrome-signin on a chromebook
2) Enter `google@d11.org` as the email and complete the captcha/security check
3) Click sign-in options
4) When prompted, click Sign in with Github
5) Click on Docs
6) Scroll to the bottom and click on Pricing
7) In the search bar type "google"
8) In the right sidebar click on `google.com`
9) You now have a tab that is unaffected by any extensions

# BYOD shits and bypasses

## Wifi instructions
Based on the recent changes pushed by FCPS, the best way to bypass their restrictions is to BYOD. 

**You can also do this if you unenrolled your chromebook or flashed a Windows laptop (if you have one somehow)**

To properly do BYOD, you *probably* shouldn't use the FCPS provided installer as your go-to option. Instead, use the wifi passwords in this repo to connect to their wifi directly (if that works).
The certs that I managed to get my hands on may or may not work. Afaik it depends on the computer and/or the OS.

To use the installer, sign in a GUEST, NOT with your FCPS username. Download the certs manually and install as per the instructions provided. DO NOT use `2.2.2.2`, use `https://xprsscnctvm.fcps.edu/enroll/FairfaxCountyPublicSchools/Production/reset` instead.

## Chrome DNS (BYOD only)

If you are bringing your own computer, you can do this to prevent sites being blocked

# Windows laptops and PCs

FCPS no longer gives out windows laptops to everyone. The previously working methods have been patched on their course specific windows PCs and most likely on the personal windows laptops as well.

CS students are now given access to personal windows laptops instead of chromebooks, but again they will need to be flashed and have their BIOS passwords reset so as to reinstall the OS. 

Windows PCs and laptops have a bundled installation of Java 17, located in `C:/Program Files (x86)/jGRASP/bundled/java/bin/java.exe`. This can be used to run modern Java software, including (but not limited to) Java based source ports of many older games. Look [here](https://github.com/catfoolyou/Block-Bypass/edit/main/README.md#windows-pc-games) instructions on running Java ports of Doom and Quake 2 (included as examples.) 

The following [script](https://github.com/catfoolyou/EaglerGradleScripts/blob/main/EaglerGradle.bat) is linked as an example of setting up gradle to work with a bundled Java installation. The same repo contains modified `build.gradle` and `gradle.properties` for compiling Java applications with a bundled installation.

# Chromebook games
Again, use a [proxy](https://github.com/catfoolyou/Ultraviolet-App) to access blocked websites. Be advised that games (and sometimes yt) are somewhat laggy over a proxy connection.

If [catfoolyou.github.io](https://catfoolyou.github.io) is blocked, a mirror of my website is available [here](https://eldritchdev2.github.io/Website-v2/)

### Eaglercraft and FNAW:
The latest 1.5.2 and 1.8.8 offline clients are available for download, as well as Five Nights at Winston's.

### Other games:
Doom, Retal, Quake, Slope, Bananabread and all of the other games that must run in a web environment cannot be run locally. Might migrate my site soon.

# Windows PC games

### Quake 2
Download [platform_wx_full.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f1yspvrcart3delf87uss/platform_wx_full.zip?rlkey=q0yu8x3ab4yn6ktwwrvcmk1ux&st=swq45p8a&dl=0), extract, go to the `bin` folder and run `fullgame.bat +set basedir "Quake 2"`

### Doom
Download `mochadoom.jar`, get the IWADS and run `java -jar mochadoom.jar -iwad file.wad` replacing `file.wad` with your IWAD file

[^1]: On chromebooks with Ti50 boards or all of them??
